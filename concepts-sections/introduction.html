<h1>Core concepts</h1>
<h2>Servers</h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2>User accounts</h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>Note that as an open system, to provide true interoperability, Pryv does not set or enforce &quot;ownership&quot; of data per app. Provided the necessary permissions, data stored by a given app can be accessed and manipulated by any other app.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>TODO: rewrite</p>
<p>The core of Pryv data are <em>events</em>, i.e. timestamped pieces of typed data, or <strong>events</strong>. Some example events are: thoughts, audio notes, photos, geographical coordinates, etc. (see the <a href="event-types.html#directory">event type directory</a>).</p>
<h2>Streams</h2>
<p>TODO: rewrite</p>
<p>Each event belongs to a <strong>stream</strong>. Streams usually match either organizational aspects (depending on the user, e.g. journal, photos, etc.) or data sources (like specific apps and/or devices), and follow a hierarchical organization (i.e. streams can contain sub-streams). There are a few standard streams there for your app to use (see <a href="standard-structure.html">standard structure</a>), but if you manage rather specific stuff you&#39;ll probably want your app to create and use its own stream. Many apps (e.g. data collection) will typically just deal with a single stream.</p>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>TODO: rewrite</p>
<p>Events can be further classified and organized using <strong>tags</strong>. Tags offer typical flat, many-to-many organization for labeling and filtering events. One event can be tagged with multiple tags. For example, personal notes could be tagged as <em>fun</em> or <em>important</em>, or professional activities could be tagged as <em>prospection</em>, <em>meeting</em>, <em>development</em> or <em>support</em>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="standard-structure.html">standard streams and tags</a> we encourage you to use when appropriate if you want your app to integrate nicely within the user&#39;s Pryv experience.</p>
<h2><a id="sharing"></a>Accesses and sharing</h2>
<p>TODO: rewrite</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Apps access a user&#39;s activity data by presenting the API with an <strong>access token</strong>, meaning a specific instance of <strong>access</strong> to the data has been granted. An access can be <em>shared</em>, associated to an <em>app</em> or <em>personal</em>.</p>
<h3>Types of access</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shared</strong> accesses can be freely defined for letting other users view and possibly contribute to their data. They only grant access to a specific set of the user&#39;s data (see details below).</p>
<p>  A <strong>shared access</strong> grants permissions to one or more of the user&#39;s stream(s), and further permissions within those streams, like on tags and/or a limited time frame, can be defined to filter events. Accesses allow sharing in a variety of ways, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>in-app: the user chooses to share some events with another Pryv user, which is notified and can select to view (and possibly contribute to) the shared data and/or integrate it with her own (add it to her sharing bookmarks).</li>
<li>URL copy-paste: the user choose to share data with another person (possibly not a Pryv user), and copies the full URL containing the access token into an e-mail or chat message. The other person can open the URL and access the web app to view (and possibly contribute to) the shared data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>App</strong> accesses are assigned to most apps to access the user&#39;s data on her behalf. They also only grant access to a specific set of data, determined by the app&#39;s needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Personal</strong> accesses are used by trusted apps only. They grant full access to the user&#39;s data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that only trusted apps can view and manage app and personal accesses. If you want to build a trusted app, please <a href="mailto:developers@pryv.com">get in touch with us</a>.</p>
