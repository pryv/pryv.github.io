<p><a href="http://w.pryv.com">Pryv</a> is a service empowering people with a simple, trusted space reuniting the streams that matter under their control. It handles any type of timestamped data, modeling individual pieces as <em>events</em> (stuff that happens) and contextualizing them into <em>streams</em> and <em>tags</em> (the circumstances in which stuff happens).</p>
<p>The Pryv API is an HTTP and web sockets API that enables apps &amp; services to interact with Pryv events and contexts.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Pryv is a decentralized service, with each user account accessed from an endpoint on the server storing its data (e.g. <code>https://galileo.pryv.io/</code>). There can be as many servers as there are accounts.</p>
<p>Users collect, manipulate and view events on their account (or other users&#39; accounts) via apps, which are granted access to the parts of user data they need (e.g. specific streams). Apps can interoperate provided they support the same event types and are granted access to the same data.</p>
<p>Stored data is all private by default. Users share data by explicitly opening read-only or collaborative accesses to specific parts of their data.</p>
<h2>Why we made it</h2>
<p><strong>TODO: some of this should move elsewhere (e.g. blog or FAQ)</strong></p>
<p><strong>TODO: - possibly define what we mean by &quot;open&quot; - explain we&#39;re against &quot;data == new oil&quot; and that we want data to be valuable in the way you, the user, choose</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s a long story with many details you&#39;d rather not know, but one thing we can all tell is that there&#39;s a definite convergence towards reuniting people&#39;s data into a single space and towards more privacy and user control. This is happening, for the good (of most of us—those with businesses involving gory sacrifices of their users personal data for advertisers to feast on would probably prefer a different course of things).
On the one hand, new apps and services now pop up regularly, each with their own angle on the matter (journaling, lifelogging/quantified self, travelling, etc.). On the other, initiatives such as <a href="https://tent.io">Tent</a> aim to define the decentralized protocol that will bind all of this together and hand ultimate control to the user.
Here we stand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things aren&#39;t ready today for most end-users to host their own servers, so we chose to focus on offering a service first.</li>
<li>A service reuniting an individual&#39;s most relevant personal data should offer means to generically visualize and browse this data, in the same way operating systems offer interfaces such as the OSX Finder or Windows Explorer. We believe <a href="#TODO">our take on this</a> is quite appropriate and unique.</li>
<li>Such a service must provide hard-core guarantees about privacy, ownership and control, and that this can only be truly achieved with data decentralization (on the technical side) and full transparency and openness (on the business side).</li>
<li>We believe in the advent of an open protocol ultimately, and we will work to support that, but we think developers need a simple and friendly platform to build on today. We also want to help shaping this future protocol by example.</li>
<li>We build this platform upfront, with the challenges it implies. We&#39;ve been tempted by alternative, more &quot;investor-friendly&quot; approaches to build significant user traction first, such as focusing on a single-purpose, &quot;vertical&quot; app (lifelogging, social...), but we acknowledged this would only distract us from our goal. We believe that pursuing this goal stubbornly, openly and transparently has all the power we need to federate a community of like-minded developers building a new breed of user-centric apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What you can build with it</h2>
<p>Despite the name Pryv, which reflects our primary intent to stand for user privacy and control, you can build mostly anything on top of the API. Everyone will benefit most if your apps are designed for interoperability—possibly making use of and enriching data from other sources—and so we recommend the use of standard types and contexts, but this is by no means an obligation.
Our dearest hope, though, is that whatever you contribute will work to help people reclaim control over their digital lives, cultivating simplicity, honesty and trust, and putting human relationships at the forefront. It feels good, too.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s just underline the fundamental principle all apps running on Pryv are built on, which can represent a significant change of perspective: Pryv users own and control their data. Pryv is set to ensure that apps are built with the sole focus of bringing value to users, to avoid users ever becoming the product again.
